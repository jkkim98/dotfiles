.files

How to use:

1. Clone this repo in ~
2. Rename .git as .dotfilegit so an accidental `git clean -xdf` doesn't wipe everything
3. To add a file, add it to the .gitignore file with a `!` at the start
4. Use the normal git commands like `git --git-dir=.dotfilegit status` or use the alias `dfgit`
5. Enjoy :)
